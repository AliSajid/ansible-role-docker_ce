Install and configure Docker CE on your system.

Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/resources/playbook.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - robertdebock.docker_ce
```

The machine you are running this on, may need to be prepared, I use this playbook to ensure everything is in place to let the role work.
```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes
  serial: 30%

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.bootstrap
    - role: robertdebock.epel
    - role: robertdebock.buildtools
    - role: robertdebock.python_pip
```

After running this role, this playbook runs to verify that everything works, this may be a good example how you can use this role.
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Create a container
      docker_container:
        name: openssh
        image: robertdebock/docker-centos-openssh
        ports:
          - "2222:22"
      when:
        - ansible_virtualization_type != "docker"
```

Also see a [full explanation and example](https://robertdebock.nl/how-to-use-these-roles.html) on how to use these roles.

Role Variables
--------------

These variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for docker_ce
```

Requirements
------------

- Access to a repository containing packages, likely on the internet.
- A recent version of Ansible. (Tests run on the current, previous and next release of Ansible.)

The following roles can be installed to ensure all requirements are met, using `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml`:

```yaml
---
- robertdebock.bootstrap
- robertdebock.epel
- robertdebock.buildtools
- robertdebock.python_pip

```

-------

This role is a part of many compatible roles. Have a look at [the documentation of these roles](https://robertdebock.nl/) for further information.

Here is an overview of related roles:

This role has been tested on these [container images](https://hub.docker.com/):

|container|tags|
|---------|----|
|debian|buster|
|el|7|
|fedora|30, 31|
|ubuntu|bionic|

The minimum version of Ansible required is 2.8 but tests have been done to:

- The previous version, on version lower.
- The current version.
- The development version.

Exceptions
----------

Some variarations of the build matrix do not work. These are the variations and reasons why the build won't work:

| variation                 | reason                 |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Alpine | Not supported. |
| Archlinux | Not supported. |
| Debian unstable | Not supported. |
| CentOS 8 | Not supported. |
| OpenSUSE Leap | Not supported. |
| Ubuntu devel | Not supported. |


Testing
-------

[Unit tests](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-docker_ce) are done on every commit, pull request, release and periodically.

If you find issues, please register them in [GitHub](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-docker_ce/issues)

Testing is done using [Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Molecule](https://github.com/ansible/molecule):

[Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) tests multiple ansible versions.
[Molecule](https://github.com/ansible/molecule) tests multiple distributions.

To test using the defaults (any installed ansible version, namespace: `robertdebock`, image: `fedora`, tag: `latest`):

```
molecule test

# Or select a specific image:
image=ubuntu molecule test
# Or select a specific image and a specific tag:
image="debian" tag="stable" tox
```

Or you can test multiple versions of Ansible, and select images:
Tox allows multiple versions of Ansible to be tested. To run the default (namespace: `robertdebock`, image: `fedora`, tag: `latest`) tests:

```
tox

# To run CentOS (namespace: `robertdebock`, tag: `latest`)
image="centos" tox
# Or customize more:
image="debian" tag="stable" tox
```
